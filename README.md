# SessionSync AI

In a DIALL's therapist's workday, where time is of the essence and Client-care is paramount, we introduce a transformative tool: SESSIONSYNC: a session history chatbot tailored for therapists. This innovative solution streamlines session note management and patient progress tracking, simplifying the retrieval of pivotal information through intuitive queries. Designed to integrate seamlessly into a therapist’s workflow, our chatbot diminishes administrative load, freeing practitioners to devote more time to what truly matters—personalized patient care. ​
